# üé• Movie Recommendation System - "Le Cruise"

## üìã Overview
This project was created as part of our training at **Wild Code School**. The goal was to design and implement a **movie recommendation system** for a local cinema in the Creuse region of France. The cinema sought to modernize its services by offering personalized movie suggestions to its customers via an online platform. This project serves as a foundational prototype for their ambitions.
